# [Python] Data Anyalysis of Experimental Data

This is a project for my course Computational Physics at the University of Manchester.

The aim of this computational physics project was to determine the spreading law for a picolitre droplet by analysing the time variation
of its radii.

I used Python to perform data analysis on a few sets of experimental data that measured the time variation of two picolitre droplets’ radii, from the top and side view of the first droplet and from only the top view of the second droplet.

Using Python, values of contact line speed and contact angle for each droplet at each instant of time were deduced from its recorded time 
and radii values. Plots of contact line speed against contact angle for each droplet were produced to determine the spreading laws which 
relate eachdroplet’s contact anglesto its contact line speeds.

The first droplet was found to have smaller contact angles and its spreading law was best approximated by the de Gennes spreading law with a reduced chi-sq of 0.84. The second droplet was found to have larger contact angles and its spreading law was best approximated by the Cox-Voinov spreading law with a reduced chi-sq of 1.16.

All results can be found in the pdf file.
